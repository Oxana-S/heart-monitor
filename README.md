### Simple test site.

#### Prepared to evaluate my skills in using basic frontend development tools.

The following tools were used as an example of code preparation:   
 - *HTML*, 
 - *CSS/SCSS*, 
 - *JS/JQuery*, 
 - *Gulp*.      
When coding the site used *flexbox*.

The site provides basic blocks, as:
- *animation of elements and blocks*, 
- *slide*, 
- *tabs*, 
- *forms and* 
- *scripts for forms, popups, connected google map*.
