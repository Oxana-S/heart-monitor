#### Prepared to evaluate my skills in using basic frontend development tools.

The following tools were used as an example of code preparation:   
 - *HTML*, 
 - *CSS/SCSS*, 
 - *JS/JQuery*, 
 - *Gulp*.      

When coding the site, used *Flexbox* and streaming task runner *Gulp*.

The site provides basic blocks, as:
- *animation of elements and blocks*, 
- *slider*, 
- *tabs*,
- *popup's*
- *forms and* 
- *scripts for form's, popup's, connected google map*.
